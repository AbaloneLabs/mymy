## ✨ Overview

**mymy** brings your AI agents, project files, and operating data into a single local interface. Instead of juggling terminals, browser tabs, prompts, and scattered files, you get one workspace to:

- **Create native agents** backed by registered LLM providers
- **Keep agent work inside Drive** under `/drive/agents`, `/drive/projects`, and `/drive/shared`
- **Edit prompts** (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`) from the agent UI and the Drive tab
- **Open files and previews** for generated markdown, images, media, PDFs, docx text, and local dev servers
- **Run agent commands through a sandbox runner** with private agent roots plus shared/project mounts
- **Chat with agents**, attach files, review tool/search output, track tasks/goals/finance/investments, and manage your calendar
- **Stay locked & private** with PIN-based access (no cloud accounts, no login flows)

It's designed for the **one-person business** — the developer-founder who wears every hat and delegates the rest to agents.

## 🚀 Features

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 🔐 | **PIN Authentication** | Server-side PIN sessions with an HttpOnly cookie and an explicit first-run owner credential. |
| 🤖 | **Native Agent Management** | Create/delete agents, edit prompts, select the active agent globally, and run chat sessions against registered LLM providers. |
| 📁 | **Drive Workspace** | Browse, edit, upload, delete, restore, and purge files under `/drive/projects`, `/drive/agents`, and `/drive/shared`; view md, docx text, images, audio, video, and PDFs. |
| 🧱 | **Sandbox Runner** | Agent file-write, terminal, code, and long-running jobs execute through a dedicated runner with bubblewrap isolation by default. |
| 🖥️ | **Preview Proxy** | Agents can register dev-server ports with `register_preview`; the UI opens tokenized preview URLs through the API. |
| 📁 | **Project Workspace** | Projects get stable Drive folders and can be linked to chats and work sessions. |

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & Docker Compose
- (For local dev) [bun](https://bun.sh/) ≥ 1.3 and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) toolchain

### Run with Docker

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone <your-repo-url> mymy && cd mymy

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Launch
docker compose up -d --build
```

Before the first start, set a private owner PIN with at least eight characters:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set MYMY_INITIAL_PIN in .env, start the stack once, then remove the value.
docker compose up -d
```

The default stack runs the sandbox runner on an internal-only Docker network,
uses a separate user namespace for commands, and exposes no runner host port.
The API and runner share a generated purpose-bound control token stored outside
the mountable agent data root; untrusted commands never receive it. Foreground
commands also use a separate network namespace. Long-running preview processes
share the runner network only so their selected port can be forwarded, and
unauthenticated access to the runner control API is rejected.
On the supported Docker/AppArmor host, bubblewrap still requires `SYS_ADMIN`
plus seccomp/AppArmor exceptions for namespace mount operations; treat the
runner container as a privileged boundary. Host KVM/TUN devices and
`NET_ADMIN` remain absent. Firecracker adds those only through the explicit
`docker-compose.firecracker.yml` overlay and requires a dedicated host security
review; it is not enabled by the normal command.

Open **http://localhost:33696** (or
**http://&lt;server-LAN-address&gt;:33696**) and enter the initial PIN `mymy`.
Change it immediately in Settings before exposing the web gateway to a shared network.
`MYMY_INITIAL_PIN` may override that value on the first start; new PINs must
contain at least four characters.
Provider credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using OS-generated nonces
and an Argon2id PIN-derived key. A successful owner login upgrades historical
HKDF-encrypted rows atomically before the session becomes usable.

### Memory lifecycle and export

Automatic recall is scoped to the active agent and project and treats recalled
text as untrusted evidence, never as action authority. Conversation extraction
is local-only, disabled by default, and does not backfill turns from disabled
periods. Deleting a memory scrubs its content and source links atomically while
retaining a non-content tombstone, idempotency receipt, and deletion watermark
to prevent delayed work from restoring it. The Agents memory view can export
the complete lifecycle ledger for one profile; deleted source content is never
included in that export.

### Local Development

```bash
# Database
docker compose up -d db

# Frontend
cd web
bun install
bun run dev      # http://localhost:5173 (HMR)

# Backend (in another terminal)
cd api
DATABASE_URL=postgres://mymy:mymy@localhost:33432/mymy cargo run
```

`sqlx::query!` checks require a live PostgreSQL schema during local backend
builds, clippy, and tests:

```bash
cd api
DATABASE_URL=postgres://mymy:mymy@localhost:33432/mymy cargo build
DATABASE_URL=postgres://mymy:mymy@localhost:33432/mymy cargo clippy -- -D warnings
DATABASE_URL=postgres://mymy:mymy@localhost:33432/mymy cargo test
```

## 🔧 Configuration

App configuration is split between environment variables and the in-app
**Settings** page (`/settings`):

| Section | What you configure |
|---------|-------------------|
| **General** | Change your PIN |
| **Models / LLM Providers** | Register OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Ollama, or local provider endpoints |
| **Agents** | Configure per-agent app data permissions |
| **Skills / Extensions** | Configure native skills, MCP servers, and extension integrations |
| **Git Integrations** | Connect GitHub, GitLab, Gitea (host, port, SSH alias) |
| **About** | Version & port info |

Runtime settings are served by the Rust backend. Stored Git API tokens are never
returned by the settings API.

### Auth

- `GET /api/health` is public.
- Protected API routes require the `mymy_session` HttpOnly cookie.
- Repeated invalid PIN attempts are rate-limited with a short lockout.
- Fresh installations use `mymy`; change this public bootstrap value before
  allowing network access.
- Set `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true` only when the API is served over HTTPS.

### Drive, Sandbox, and Previews

The API stores Drive data under `MYMY_AGENT_DATA_DIR`:

```text
/drive
  /projects/<project-slug>     project workspaces
  /agents/<agent-profile>      private agent workspace with AGENTS.md and SOUL.md
  /shared                      cross-agent shared files
```

Drive supports create/edit/upload/delete, a trash workflow with restore and
purge, and optional background S3 synchronization jobs. Native agent file tools
resolve paths only inside the current agent workspace plus explicitly granted
shared/project roots. Other agents' private folders are not granted as tool
roots.

The Docker stack starts a separate `sandbox-runner` service on container port
`33698`; the default profile does not publish that port to the host.
The API sends terminal commands, code execution, and long-running sandbox
processes to this runner when `MYMY_SANDBOX_RUNNER_URL` is configured. Native
agents receive only the tools allowed by their per-domain permissions. Dangerous
shell commands and sensitive file writes are blocked by the runtime guardrails.

The API keeps durable sandbox process metadata, preview registration, and runner
status reconciliation in a shared service used by both HTTP handlers and native
agent tools. Drive workspace resolution is also centralized: chat turns, sandbox
processes, prompt editing, and file tools all receive the same private
agent/shared/project root set before the runner mounts or stages files.

In the default Compose setup, the runner uses bubblewrap to create PID, IPC,
UTS, and mount isolation, mounts the selected agent workspace plus shared/project
roots at logical `/drive/...` paths, and keeps process logs under the Drive data
volume. The bubblewrap child receives only minimal `/dev` nodes (`null`, `zero`,
`full`, `random`, `urandom`) instead of the runner container's device surface.
Commands run in a separate user namespace by default. The supported Docker
kernel does not allow that nested namespace to mount procfs, so the child sees
an empty `/proc`; runner-owned process APIs provide status and termination
without exposing the outer container process table. The generated runner
control token is stored in the separate runner-control volume at
`/run/mymy/runner-control.token`, outside `MYMY_RUNNER_DATA_ROOT`, with mode
`0600`. Workspace exports do not include that control volume.

Firecracker mode is available when the deployment provides a Firecracker binary,
guest kernel, ext4 rootfs, and SSH key. The runner creates one VM per foreground
command or managed background process, copies only the allowed Drive roots into
the guest, runs the command over SSH, copies writable roots back on exit/stop,
and opens an in-runner TCP proxy for preview ports so existing
`/api/previews/<token>` URLs continue to work. The default local stack still
uses bubblewrap because Firecracker needs host KVM and guest assets:

```bash
MYMY_SANDBOX_MODE=bubblewrap
MYMY_SANDBOX_UNSHARE_USER=true
MYMY_SANDBOX_RUNNER_URL=http://sandbox-runner:33698
MYMY_SANDBOX_RUNNER_TOKEN_FILE=/run/mymy/runner-control.token
MYMY_SANDBOX_PREVIEW_HOST=sandbox-runner
```

For Firecracker, prepare assets on the host and mount them read-only into the
runner:

```bash
scripts/prepare-firecracker-assets.sh ./data/firecracker-assets

MYMY_SANDBOX_MODE=firecracker
FIRECRACKER_ASSETS_DIR=./data/firecracker-assets
FIRECRACKER_BIN=/app/data/agent/firecracker-assets/firecracker
FIRECRACKER_KERNEL_IMAGE=/app/data/agent/firecracker-assets/vmlinux
FIRECRACKER_ROOTFS_IMAGE=/app/data/agent/firecracker-assets/rootfs.ext4
FIRECRACKER_SSH_KEY_PATH=/app/data/agent/firecracker-assets/id_rsa
```

Development servers started by an agent can be exposed through preview
endpoints. The `terminal` tool can start managed background processes with
`background=true`, optional `port`, and optional `label`; companion tools
`list_processes`, `read_process_logs`, and `stop_process` let the agent inspect
and stop its own jobs. The runtime tool `register_preview` can also register a
local forwarded port and create a tokenized `/api/previews/<token>` URL. The
proxy accepts loopback targets for local development and the configured sandbox
preview host used by the Docker runner, while rejecting arbitrary hosts to avoid
becoming an open proxy.

The Processes tab exposes the same durable process state to the user: sandbox
runtime status, managed process rows, CPU/RAM/storage metrics, open ports,
preview links, logs, graceful stop, and force kill.

Optional S3 provider settings:

```bash
MYMY_DRIVE_S3_BUCKET=
MYMY_DRIVE_S3_REGION=
MYMY_DRIVE_S3_ENDPOINT=
```

When these are unset, Drive uses only the local Docker volume.

### CI

GitLab CI is configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml` for the shell runner tagged
`Ubuntu Runner`. The pipeline runs:

- Repository whitespace and Docker Compose config checks
- Rust format, clippy (`-D warnings`), build, tests, and RustSec audit
- Secret scanning with gitleaks
- Web ESLint, Bun audit, and production build
- API and web Docker image builds with smoke checks

Rust jobs start an isolated `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container, apply the SQL
migrations, and then run `cargo` with `DATABASE_URL` set for `sqlx::query!`
compile-time checks.

The RustSec audit ignores `RUSTSEC-2023-0071` because it is pulled in through
`sqlx-mysql`'s optional RSA authentication dependency while this project enables
only PostgreSQL `sqlx` features.

Registry publishing, deployment automation, and hosted monitoring are not
configured in this repository. Those require a separate external infrastructure
decision.

### Ports

mymy uses the **33xxx** range to avoid conflicts with common services:

| Service | Port |
|---------|------|
| Web (frontend) | `33696` |
| API (Rust) | `33697` |
| Sandbox runner | `33698` (internal only) |
| PostgreSQL | `33432` |
